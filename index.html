        <p>Irrigation is the artificial application of water to land or soil to assist in the growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of landscapes, and revegetation of disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of inadequate rainfall. It also helps in protecting plants against frost, suppressing weed growth in grain fields, and preventing soil consolidation.

            In addition to delivering water to crops, irrigation can also supply nutrients to them. The main sources of water for irrigation include wells, ponds, lakes, canals, tube-wells, and dams. The methods of irrigation vary widely and include surface irrigation, localized irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, drip irrigation, center pivot irrigation, and sub-irrigation, among others. The choice of method depends on factors such as water availability, crop type, soil composition, and local practices.</p>
